-- 1. What is the product name(s) of the most expensive products?
-- HINT: Find the max price in a subquery and then use that value to find products
-- whose price equals that value. (Some of your answers from Exercise 3.A may offer a
-- useful starting point.

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM products
WHERE UnitPrice = (
SELECT MAX(UnitPrice)
FROM products
);


-- 2. What is the product name(s) and categories of the least expensive products?
-- HINT: Find the min price in a subquery and then use that in your more complex
-- query that joins products with categories.

SELECT p.ProductName, c.CategoryName, p.UnitPrice
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c 
ON c.CategoryID = p.CategoryID
WHERE p.UnitPrice = (
SELECT MIN(UnitPrice)
FROM products
);


-- 3. What is the order id, shipping name and shipping address of all orders shipped via
-- "Federal Shipping"?
-- HINT: Find the shipper id of "Federal Shipping" in a subquery and then use that
-- value to find the orders that used that shipper.
-- You do not need "Federal Shipping" to display in the results.

SELECT OrderID, ShipName, ShipAddress
FROM orders 
WHERE ShipVia = (
SELECT ShipperID
FROM shippers
WHERE CompanyName = 'Federal Shipping'
);


-- 4. What are the order ids of the orders that included "Sasquatch Ale"?
-- HINT: Find the product id of "Sasquatch Ale" in a subquery and then use that value
-- to find the matching orders from the `order details` table.
-- Your final results only need to display OrderID, but you may find it helpful to include
-- additional columns as you work on creating the query to better understand how the
-- query is working.

SELECT OrderID
FROM `order details`
WHERE ProductID = (
SELECT ProductID
FROM products
WHERE ProductName = 'Sasquatch Ale'
);
